# Nintendo DS - Tank Game

Making an NDS game (or potentially a 3DS game in the future) based on the [Wii Tanks](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Tanks!) game. Very early stages development right now. Mostly just a fun passion project.

Using [libnds](https://github.com/devkitPro/libnds) in [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) for development.

## Build Instructions

1. Install devkitPro (linked above)
2. Clone this repo into the `devkitPro/examples/nds` directory
3. In any of the game revisions (v1, v2, etc) run `make` to generate the `.nds` file
